# ARTv2
Suite of tools for Autodesk Maya to help with skeleton creation, skeleton placement, rig creation, and final animation.

ARTv2 is currently in alpha and is not feature complete. When ARTv2 is feature complete, it will be released on the Unreal Engine Marketplace. This repository will always have the latest code, but may not always be as thoroughly tested as what would be on the marketplace.
